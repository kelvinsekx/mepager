      <p>  I am an economist,educator and software developer. I am a fresh graduate from the University of Ibadan exploring the web.</p>
      <p>
          Although, You might not have access to my economy predictions and education works, you can invite me for talks and I will be glad to show my educator skills. On a good side, my software development works are available publicly on 
          <a href="https://www.github.com/kelvinsekx">Github</a>.

          By the way I paint too. I have not been able to take my paintings very serious but you can check my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/6eks">instagram</a> on some silly paintings and drawings I did.
      </p>
      <p>Also, I have a <a href="https://www.kelvinsekx.codes/articles">tech-blog</a> which I maintain actively for now. I like to call it articles though because I use it as a platform to document things I know about web development and I like to share - if you dont do tech,please reach out to me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/utdkelvin">Twitter</a> or give me an hi-5 when you see me pass bye.</p>

      <p>I grew up in Ibadan,Nigeria, with my primary, secondary and university education in Ibadan. If you happen to speak yoruba, my Yoruba name is <b>Oluwatimileyin</b>.</p>

      <p>Besides programming or studying one of the economics books around or probably spending leisure time in jaypluz salon, I love to talk, take walk, jog once in a while, spend time with my single mother and awesome extended family.</p>
