      <h2>Education</h2>

      <p>I grew up in Ibadan,Nigeria, with my primary, secondary and university education in Ibadan. </p>

      <p>My primary school education was rough so there is no precise primary school I attended. I had a mix of private schools and public schools for my primary. But I managed to finish from Lam Adeshina Primary School, Felele, Ibadan.</p>

      <p>The secondary school I attended is called Rochas Foundation College, Ibadan. With a cap from the University of Ibadan.</p>
